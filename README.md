3. ### How is a batteryless device powered?

    The KryptonArc Smart modular padlock does not rely on solar or wind power or any other environmental factor, instead, it utilizes the Qi  or NFC wireless power protocol. New smartphones not only have the ability to wirelessly receive power but also to emit power. Users can conveniently manage and power Krypton Arc devices using their Qi-capable phones. Simply place your smartphone near the smart padlock, and it will supply power to the padlock. Once the padlock completes its action, you can safely remove your smartphone. If your phone does not support the Qi Protocol, there are power packs available in the market that can transmit power wirelessly using the Qi Protocol.

4. ### Why is KryptonArc open-source?
    
    In recent times, there have been instances of individuals experiencing unexplained suspensions of their accounts on cloud and social platforms. We firmly believe that your access rights and security should not be dictated by corporations.

At KryptonArc, we highly prioritize community-driven innovation and individual ownership. Our mission is to empower users with absolute control over their privacy and security.
